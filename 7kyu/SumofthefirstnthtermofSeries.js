// Task
// Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input parameter).
// You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.
// Rules
// You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.
// If the given value is 0 then it should return "0.00".
// You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

// ðŸ‘Œ SOLUTION
function SeriesSum(n) {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  result += 1 / (1 + 3 * (i - 1));
  }
  return result.toFixed(2);
}

console.log(SeriesSum(5));
